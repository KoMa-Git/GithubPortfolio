# Welcome to my Software Testing and Coding Portfolio

This repository showcases my ongoing journey in the world of software testing and coding. It is a constantly evolving space where I demonstrate my skills, share knowledge, and document my learning as I grow in the field of software testing.

## Portfolio Contents

This repository contains simpler pet projects in separate folder that shows my testing and coding skills :

- **Test documentation and reports** : https://koma-git.github.io/GithubPortfolio/
- **[Flask](/Flask)** : build a mini webshop for manual and automate tests
- **[FastAPI](/FastAPI/)** : build a demo API for testing in Postman
- **[tesing_AI_testing](/testing_AI_testing/)** : AI models testing in writing codes and tests

## About Me

I am a passionate and aspiring software tester with coding skills and a strong interest in ensuring quality and enhancing user experience. I have a keen eye for detail but never lose sight of the bigger picture. For me, testing isn’t just about finding bugs—though I do enjoy digging deep to uncover the root cause of an issue—it's about building a solid foundation for reliable, user-centered software that people can trust.

This portfolio reflects my dedication to learning new testing methodologies, tools, coding and best practices, as well as my practical experience applying these skills in pet projects.
