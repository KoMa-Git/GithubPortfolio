# My Software Testing and Coding Portfolio

Welcome to my Software Testing and Python Coding Portfolio! ðŸš€

This repository showcases my ongoing journey in the world of software testing and coding. It is a constantly evolving space where I demonstrate my skills, share knowledge, and document my learning as I grow in the field of software testing.

## Portfolio Contents

This repository contains simpler pet projects in separate folder that shows my testing and coding skills :

- **[Flask](/Flask)** : build a mini homepage for test automation, learning backend-frontend connections
- **[FastAPI](/FastAPI/)** : building a demo API for testing in Postman
- **Test reports** : https://koma-git.github.io/GithubPortfolio/

## About Me

I am a passionate aspiring software tester with a deep interest in ensuring quality and improving the user experience. I believe that testing is not just about finding bugsâ€”it's about creating the foundation for robust and reliable software that users can trust. 

This portfolio reflects my dedication to learning new testing methodologies, tools, coding and best practices, as well as my practical experience applying these skills in pet projects.

## Skills

Here are some of the key areas of expertise I have been developing:

- **Manual Testing**: Test case creation, exploratory testing, defect logging, and reporting.
- **Automation Testing**: Writing and maintaining automation scripts, using frameworks like Selenium and Playwright.
- **API Testing**: Testing RESTful APIs with tools with Postman or Teste.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**: Integrating automated tests into CI/CD pipelines.
- **Bug Tracking**: Familiar with tools like Jira for managing defect lifecycle.
- **Test Management**: Using tools like Zephyr for planning and organizing test cases.

## My Testing Methodology

- **Test Early, Test Often**: I strongly advocate for early test planning and testing throughout the software development lifecycle.
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Prioritize tests based on potential risk to the productâ€™s success.
- **Collaboration**: I believe in close collaboration with developers, product managers, and other stakeholders to ensure the software meets all requirements.
- **Continuous Learning**: I constantly seek opportunities to learn new testing strategies, tools, and industry trends to stay ahead in the field.
