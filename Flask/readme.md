# Flask mini page for automate testing

## Ready:
- microsite simulating a login, register and user settings with a live database connection. Passwords keep hashed in db of course. Minimal html and css handling with Bootstrap, just to don't hurt our eyes.

## In progress... :
- Unit test made with pytest

- Automate tests made with Selenium and Playwright can find in test folder

- Test results will deploy on GitHub Pages with help of Allure.
