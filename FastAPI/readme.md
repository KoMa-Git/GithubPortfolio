# FastAPI learning project

I got tired of searching for free APIs to experiment with, so I decided to create my own. Building this FastAPI app has been a great way to learn how APIs work in real life. Not only did I get to explore FastAPI's capabilities, but I also gained hands-on experience with API development and testing.

# Project description
This FastAPI application provides a basic set of APIs that demonstrate how to:

- Create RESTful routes
- Handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Work with path parameters, query parameters, and request bodies
- Test API responses and interact with data

Instead of relying on pre-built APIs, this project allowed me to experiment and see how an API is structured, tested, and improved through development. I used this experience to build a deeper understanding of the technology and workflows behind building APIs.

You can check deployed FastAPI docs page thanks to Render.com on the following link:

## In progress... :

- Postman collections for easy API testing in near future.
