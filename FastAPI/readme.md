## Beyond testing its a FastAPI learning project

I got tired of searching for free APIs to experiment with, so I decided to create my own. Learning by doing is not just a great way to explore FastAPI's capabilities â€” this experience helps to build a deeper understanding of the technology and workflows behind building APIs. Please note that it still has a lot of issues (such as impractical response bodies and some misconceptions), but I'm not afraid to make these mistakes, as I'm learning from them.

## Future plans:

- JMeter performance tests, report
- Jenkins and containerization

## ðŸ›  Skills
Postman, Python, SQL
