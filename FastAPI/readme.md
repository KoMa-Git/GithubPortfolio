# FastAPI learning project

I got tired of searching for free APIs to experiment with, so I decided to create my own. Learning by doing is not just a great way to explore FastAPI's capabilities â€” this experience helps to build a deeper understanding of the technology and workflows behind building APIs. Please note that it still has a lot of issues (such as impractical response bodies and some misconceptions), but I'm not afraid to make these mistakes, as I'm learning from them.

# Project description
This FastAPI application provides a basic set of APIs that demonstrate how to:

- Create RESTful routes
- Handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Work with path parameters, query parameters, and request bodies
- Test API responses and interact with data
